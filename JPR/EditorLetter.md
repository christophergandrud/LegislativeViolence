Dear Editors of the Journal of Peace Research,

I am pleased to submit my manuscript entitled "Two Sword Lengths Apart: Credible Commitment Problems and Physical Violence in Multi-party Elected National Legislatures" for review in an upcoming issue of the Journal of Peace Research.

I feel that the paper is of much interest to a wide range of JoPR readers as it makes a novel contribution to the study of political violence. The paper is the first work to theoretically and empirically understand violence between legislators in multi-party elected legislatures.

I argue that such instances of violence, rather than being simply random personally motivated attacks, are actually the result of deeper institutional problems where legislators are unable to credibly commit to follow the rules. Credible commitment problems are very much caused by legislatures where the allocation of seats and legislative resources do not closely correspond to voters' support. Using both case study and parametric regression analysis with a new global sample of legislative violence I find robust evidence for my theory.

Please feel free to contact me if you require any other information. I look forward to the reviewers's comments and suggestions.

Kind regards,
Christopher Gandrud
